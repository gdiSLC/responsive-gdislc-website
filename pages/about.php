	<h1>About Girl Develop It</h1>

	<p>
		Girl Develop It is a national non-profit organization with <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/chapters" target="_blank">chapters across the US</a> that was created to provide affordable and accessible programs to women who want to learn web and software development through mentorship and hands-on instruction.
	</p>

	<p>
		We strive to create safe and inclusive communities by encouraging questions, focusing on collaboration over competition, sharing knowledge and providing opportunities to learn and practice new skills.
	</p>

	<p>
		Everyone is welcome at our main events as long as they support the GDI mission and abide by our <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/codeofconduct" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>. We do have a few "women-only" events which are open to anyone who identifies as female.
	</p>

	<p>We have several events each month and a few larger events throughout the year. We aim to provide both social & technical events with a focus on meeting others, building skills, and sharing knowledge. 
	</p>
