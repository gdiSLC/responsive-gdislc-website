	<h1 class="large_heading">Ways to Sponsor</h1>

	<p><span class="bold">Support our local chapter:</span> <br>
		When you <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/donate" target="_blank">make a donation of $500 or more</a>, 50% will directly support our SLC chapter.
		<br><br>
		Your tax-deductible donation will help us provide scholarships for classes, local & national tech conferences, technical books for our GDI library, and more!
		<br><br>
		Our chapter is sustained through the small amount from classes and, more importantly, through
		donations from local companies. These donations are essential for our chapter and enable us to provide high-quality events for women in the local 
		tech community.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p><span class="bold">In-Kind Donations:</span> <br>
		Help us expand our GDI library, create custom swag, and offer giveaways at our events!
		<br><br>
		<a href="http://amzn.com/w/3OA280P7QIUL9" target="_blank">Donate an item on our GDI SLC Wish List</a>. You'll receive an in-kind donation receipt (tax-deductible), advertising as a GDI SLC sponsor, our everlasting gratitude, and all the karma for being such an amazing person!

	<p><span class="bold">Sponsor our snacks:</span> <br>
		Our classes require a lot of brainpower - students learning programming for the very first time! - 
		so we like to keep our students fueled with food when we have the funds to do it. 
		<br><br>
		For evening workshops, that means a light dinner and for weekend workshops, it's usually lunch and snacks. If you'd like to sponsor the food for an upcoming workshop, please <a href="mailto:saltlakecity@girldevelopit.com">send us a message</a>.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p><span class="bold">Volunteer your space:</span> <br>
		We've had a lot of great spaces for our workshops, but we can always use more - we don't want to exhaust our current spaces and hosts. 
		<br><br>
		We look for spaces that have
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<li>a projector</li>
				<li>plenty of outlets</li>
				<li>tables & chairs for 15-20 students</li>
				<li>enough space for students to sit with other students & room for TAs to walk around</li>
			</ul>
		We host classes and are always interested in space in the Central Salt Lake County area. Close to public transit is a huge plus!
		<br><br>
		Our classes are either on weekday evenings or on weekends, and sometimes stretch over multiple days. If you have a space in your office that you'd like to volunteer for a class or two, please <a href="mailto:saltlakecity@girldevelopit.com">send us a message</a>.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p><span class="bold">Donate new or gently used laptops:</span> <br>
		GDI SLC aims to remove as many barriers for women to learn as possible. Your donated laptop will help local women to gain the knowledge & skills they need to enter the workforce.
		<br><br>
		<span class="bold">Current needs:</span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li>Mac OS X laptops</li>
		</ul>	
	</p>

	<hr>
	<p>
		<span class="bold">Note:</span> We do charge our students a small amount, but it is lower than the other similar classes in Utah, and is 
		designed to be just enough to make GDI sustainable, but not necessarily profitable. 
		<br><br>
		When companies sponsor us, that means that we can support 
		more students and make sure our teachers are adequately compensated for the vast amount of time they put into teaching.
